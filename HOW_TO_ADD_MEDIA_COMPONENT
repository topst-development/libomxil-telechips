	How to add or remove libraries:
	
 	You can include or exclude omx-il component libraries from build.
	
	Most libraries were enabled to be built by default, if you want to disable one of these libraries, 
	you must explicitly disable the library by using "--disable-xxxdec" option in the configure time.
	for example, if you want to disable aacdec-component library, open the tccomxil_build file and add "--diable-aacdec" at the "./configure" part.
	
	On the other hand, the libraries listed below were disabled by default.
